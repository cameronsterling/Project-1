#  Understanding Rent Burden in the New York Metropolitan Area Using Machine Learning
This project explores the drivers of rent burden in the New York Metropolitan area using machine learning models. Rent burden, defined as spending more than 30% of household income on rent, disproportionately affects lower-income communities and contributes to financial strain and displacement. This analysis seeks to answer:

"Why does rent burden vary across different neighborhoods, and what demographic, environmental, and economic factors explain these differences?"

Files in the respository show my project report, code to engineer the data, and code for the algorithms that I used.
